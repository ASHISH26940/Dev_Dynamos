   ANTI RAGGING WEBSITE
</a></b>
 </p>

## Welcome,


## Inspiration
* Ragging Websites made by ***Central Goverment*** take their time to process the complaint made by the student.
* To solve this problem we came up with our own exclusive AOT college website

## Usecase :
* In the field of Ragging, where every second matters. Since it is directly managed by the disciplinary/Anti-Ragging committee  no complain will be left unturned.

## What problem does the project solve?

* It increases the user's interaction by making user friendly.
* The Design has been followed such that it is eyes catching so that user eyes cannot instinctively ignore the awareness spread through the website.
* It reduces the time taken to verify the document and brings the attention of the authority of the college.
* It also allows users to bring the topics that are not good for student mental health by submitting anonymous tips in the type of form.

## Overview

* In the landing page we can see the landing animation.
* It is then followed by awareness of ragging and how to prevent it.
* It has been tried to Follow the UI / UX track for the hackathon

## Challenge we ran into

* Due to sudden illness two of the very important members of our team could not participate until the end.
* First-time collaboration and some miscommunication delay in the progress.
* Were very much new to UI / UX design so building some minimalistic design took some of our time.


## Built With
* HTML, CSS - Frontend part
* JS - For Animation and Stuff
